name: "v15_test_analytics"
description: "Minimal test strategy to validate TrainingAnalyzer output"
version: "1.0"
hypothesis: "RSI oversold/overbought conditions create predictable mean reversion opportunities"

# === STRATEGY SCOPE ===
scope: "single_symbol"  # Minimal test - single symbol only

# === TRAINING APPROACH ===

# === NEURAL NETWORK MODEL ===
model:
  type: "mlp"

    # Note: uses smaller hidden layers than M2 Task 2.1 template ([64, 32])
    # to keep this a lightweight, minimal test strategy for analyzer validation.

    activation: "relu"
    output_activation: "softmax"
    dropout: 0.2
  features:

    # to minimize data requirements for this minimal analytics test.
