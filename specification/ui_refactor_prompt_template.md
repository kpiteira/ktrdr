You are contributing to the frontend of **KTRDR**, a trading research app using:

- React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Redux Toolkit for UI state (e.g., theme, sidebar)
- React Router for navigation
- A fully working backend API
- Real feature-based vertical slicing (no examples or mocks)

Your job is to implement **one feature slice**. For this task, you must:

### âœ… Required:
- Use the **existing layout** (`MainLayout`, `Sidebar`, `Router`)
- Fetch **real backend data** via the projectâ€™s `useData`/hook-based approach
- Create or update files only as listed in the task
- Ensure the route is defined in `routes.tsx` and handled by the layout
- Follow file organization under `features/<domain>/`, `api/`, and `tests/`

### ðŸš« Do NOT:
- Use mock data
- Build demo-only pages
- Add abstraction layers or helper factories
- Create new layout/Router from scratch (if already implemented)

Here is the task to implement:
