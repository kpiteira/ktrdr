# KTRDR MCP Server - End-to-End Business Goal Tests

## Overview

These tests validate the **core business objective**: enabling Claude to conduct autonomous research and discover profitable trading strategies through neural network training and comprehensive backtesting.

Unlike integration tests that verify individual tools work, these tests validate that Claude can achieve the fundamental goal of **autonomous strategy discovery**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Business Goal Test

### **Autonomous Strategy Discovery Challenge**

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
I want you to conduct autonomous research to discover a profitable trading strategy for AAPL. Use the neural network training and backtesting tools to:

1. Analyze AAPL's recent price patterns and identify potential trading signals
2. Design and train a neural network to capture these patterns  
3. Backtest the strategy across different market conditions
4. Evaluate performance and suggest improvements
5. Document your findings in the knowledge base

Success criteria:
- Strategy achieves >15% annual return
- Maximum drawdown <10%
- Sharpe ratio >1.5
- Strategy works across different market regimes
- Clear explanation of why the strategy should be profitable

Start with recent data and show your complete research process.
```

**Expected Claude Behavior:**
1. **Market Analysis**: Load and analyze AAPL data to identify patterns
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Generate specific trading hypotheses based on data
3. **Model Design**: Create neural network architectures to test hypotheses
4. **Training & Iteration**: Train models, evaluate results, refine approaches
5. **Validation**: Rigorous backtesting across multiple time periods
6. **Documentation**: Record insights and learnings for future research

**Success Indicators:**
- Claude demonstrates creative pattern recognition
- Systematic experimental methodology
- Risk-aware strategy development
- Knowledge accumulation and learning

## ðŸ§ª Advanced Research Scenarios

### **Test 1: Novel Pattern Discovery**

**Prompt:**
```
Research a novel trading hypothesis: "Earnings announcement volatility clusters predict future trend reversals."

1. Load AAPL data around recent earnings dates
2. Train a neural network to detect volatility patterns before/after earnings
3. Create a strategy that trades on these patterns
4. Backtest thoroughly and compare to buy-and-hold
5. Test generalization on TSLA and MSFT
6. Document whether this is a generalizable pattern or symbol-specific

Goal: Discover if earnings-related volatility contains predictive information for trend changes.
```

### **Test 2: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Research**

**Prompt:**
```
Build and test a diversified neural network strategy portfolio:

1. Train separate models for trend-following, mean-reversion, and momentum strategies
2. Use different timeframes (1h, 4h, 1d) for each approach
3. Backtest each strategy individually on AAPL, TSLA, MSFT
4. Find optimal allocation weights between strategies
5. Compare portfolio performance vs individual strategies
6. Document which market conditions favor each approach

Goal: Create a robust strategy portfolio that performs well across different market environments.
```

### **Test 3: Adaptive Strategy Development**

**Prompt:**
```
Develop a 'market regime aware' trading strategy:

1. Train a neural network to classify market regimes (trending, ranging, volatile)
2. Create different trading rules for each regime type
3. Train models to switch between strategies based on current market state
4. Use walk-forward analysis to test regime detection accuracy
5. Backtest the adaptive strategy vs static approaches
6. Document how well the model adapts to changing market conditions

Goal: Build a strategy that automatically adapts its behavior to current market conditions.
```

### **Test 4: Creative Hypothesis Generation**

**Prompt:**
```
Generate and test 3 completely novel trading hypotheses that go beyond traditional technical analysis. Examples might include:

- "Price movements follow musical harmonic patterns"
- "Market maker footprints are detectable in order flow"
- "Lunar cycles affect trader psychology in measurable ways"

For each hypothesis:
1. Design experiments to test the hypothesis
2. Create neural networks to detect these patterns
3. Backtest strategies based on findings
4. Document which hypotheses show promise vs those that don't

Goal: Test Claude's creativity in hypothesis generation and systematic validation.
```

## ðŸ”¬ Research Intelligence Tests

### **Test 5: Failure Analysis and Learning**

**Prompt:**
```
I want you to deliberately create and test a bad trading strategy, then systematically improve it:

1. Create an obviously flawed strategy (e.g., buy when RSI > 80, sell when RSI < 20)
2. Backtest it and analyze why it fails
3. Use the failure analysis to generate improvement hypotheses
4. Iteratively modify and retest the strategy
5. Document what you learned about strategy failure modes
6. Create a final strategy that addresses the original failures

Goal: Test Claude's ability to learn from failures and improve systematically.
```

### **Test 6: Cross-Market Validation**

**Prompt:**
```
Develop a strategy for AAPL, then test its generalizability:

1. Create and validate a profitable AAPL strategy
2. Test the same strategy on: TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN
3. Identify which elements generalize vs which are AAPL-specific
4. Modify the strategy to work across all symbols
5. Compare single-symbol vs multi-symbol performance
6. Document insights about market-specific vs universal patterns

Goal: Test ability to distinguish between generalizable patterns and overfitting.
```

## ðŸ“Š Knowledge Accumulation Tests

### **Test 7: Research Session Learning**

**Prompt:**
```
Conduct a comprehensive research session across multiple experiments:

1. Run 5-10 different strategy experiments over several hours
2. After each experiment, document key learnings in the knowledge base
3. Use insights from earlier experiments to inform later ones
4. At the end, synthesize all learnings into meta-insights about strategy development
5. Create a "research playbook" based on what worked vs what didn't

Goal: Test Claude's ability to accumulate knowledge and improve research methodology over time.
```

### **Test 8: Insight Connection and Synthesis**

**Prompt:**
```
Review all previous research experiments and:

1. Identify common patterns across successful strategies
2. Find connections between seemingly unrelated findings
3. Generate new hypotheses based on synthesized insights
4. Test strategies that combine multiple successful elements
5. Create a framework for classifying market conditions and appropriate strategies

Goal: Test ability to synthesize learnings into higher-order insights and frameworks.
```

## ðŸŽª Ultimate Challenge Test

### **The Unseen Strategy Discovery Challenge**

**Prompt:**
```
Discover a profitable trading strategy that I've never seen before. 

Rules:
- No traditional technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Must use novel pattern recognition approaches
- Strategy should have clear economic rationale
- Full research documentation required
- Must demonstrate why it should work in live markets

Use whatever data patterns, neural network architectures, and backtesting approaches you think will work. Show your complete research process and explain why your final strategy represents a genuine discovery.

This is the ultimate test: can you find profitable patterns that humans haven't already discovered?
```
