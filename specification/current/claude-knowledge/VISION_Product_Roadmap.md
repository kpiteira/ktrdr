# KTRDR Product Roadmap

## Executive Summary

KTRDR is an automated trading system built around a neuro-fuzzy decision engine. The roadmap is divided into three major versions:
- **V1 (MVP)**: Research platform to discover profitable strategies
- **V2**: Personal trading system for a $10K account  
- **V3**: Scaled automated platform

---

## Current State (December 2024)

### âœ… What's Working
- Data management with IB integration and CSV storage
- 26+ technical indicators across 6 categories
- Fuzzy logic engine with configurable membership functions
- Neural network training (realistic 42-52% accuracy)
- Complete backtesting system
- FastAPI backend with 25+ endpoints
- React frontend with visualization tools
- CLI with 30+ commands

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues
- IB Gateway disconnects frequently (Docker networking issues)
- No GPU acceleration available (Docker blocks M4 Pro access)
- Limited training data (only 15 years per symbol)
- No profitable strategy discovered yet

### ðŸ“Š Actual Performance
- Training accuracy: 42-52% (down from suspicious 77-98%)
- Backtesting has look-ahead bias (less critical for intraday)
- Models need more data for better generalization
