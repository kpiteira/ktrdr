# Autonomous Research Laboratory Architecture

## 1. Executive Summary

### Vision
We are building an autonomous AI research laboratory that discovers novel neuro-fuzzy trading strategies through continuous experimentation and learning. The system operates as a complete research organization with specialized agents handling different aspects of the scientific process.

### The Multi-Agent Research Team
The system employs five specialized AI agents, each with access to an LLM for reasoning within their domain:

1. **Assistant Researcher** - Executes experiments and analyzes results
2. **Researcher** - The creative brain that designs novel experiments
3. **Research Coordinator** - Orchestrates the research workflow and keeps everyone on task
4. **Board Agent** - Manages human communication and strategic discussions
5. **Research Director** (optional) - Manages research budget and priorities

### Key Innovation
Each agent combines LLM reasoning with specialized tools and memory, creating a true research organization. The Assistant Researcher provides detailed analytics at every stage, the Researcher generates creative hypotheses, the Coordinator ensures smooth workflow, and the Board facilitates strategic oversight.

### Expected Outcomes
- Continuous generation and testing of novel trading strategies
- Deep analysis of training dynamics and backtest results
- Accumulated knowledge that improves research efficiency
- Strategic alignment through board-level discussions
