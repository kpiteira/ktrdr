# AI Research Agents Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

### Implementation Vision
We will build the AI Research Agents system through a **thin vertical slice approach**, proving the core value proposition—that AI agents can discover novel trading insights—within 6 weeks. The implementation focuses on rapid value demonstration through phased delivery, starting with a simplified two-agent system and evolving toward the full five-agent architecture.

### Core Implementation Strategy
- **Week 1-2**: Minimal viable slice with combined Researcher/Assistant agent
- **Week 3-4**: Knowledge accumulation and quality measurement
- **Week 5-6**: Human oversight integration and validation
- **Month 2-3**: Full agent separation and production hardening
- **Month 4+**: Distributed deployment and scaling

### Key Success Metrics
- **MVP (6 weeks)**: Discover 1+ novel insights with fitness score > 0.7
- **Phase 2 (3 months)**: 10+ high-quality strategies in knowledge base
- **Phase 3 (6 months)**: Fully autonomous research generating insights daily

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- Start with human-in-the-loop for all decisions
- Measure research quality from day one
- Test on historical data before live markets
- Gradual automation based on proven results

## 2. Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Thin Vertical Slice MVP (Weeks 1-6)

#### Goal
Prove that AI agents can discover and validate novel trading insights through automated research.

#### Implementation Approach
We'll build a **minimal two-agent system** that combines the Researcher and Assistant into a single "Research Agent" initially, with a simplified Coordinator for workflow management.

#### Week 1-2: Core Research Loop
**Deliverables:**
- Single Research Agent that can design and execute experiments
- PostgreSQL schema for experiments and results
- Basic LangGraph workflow: Design → Execute → Analyze
- Integration with existing KTRDR APIs

**Implementation:**
```python
# Simplified initial agent combining Researcher + Assistant
class ResearchAgent:
    """MVP agent that both designs and executes experiments"""
    
    async def research_cycle(self):
        # 1. Generate hypothesis (Researcher role)
        hypothesis = await self.generate_hypothesis()
        
        # 2. Design experiment (Researcher role)
        experiment = await self.design_experiment(hypothesis)
        
        # 3. Execute training (Assistant role)
        results = await self.execute_training(experiment)
        
        # 4. Analyze results (Assistant role)
        insights = await self.analyze_results(results)
        
        return insights
```

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 MVP Technical Shortcuts

To achieve the 6-week MVP timeline, we'll take these pragmatic shortcuts:

#### Combined Agent Architecture
```python
# MVP: Single agent class instead of distributed services
class ResearchAgentMVP:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5)
        self.ktrdr = KTRDRClient()
        self.db = PostgreSQLClient()
        
    async def run_cycle(self):
        # All logic in one place initially
        # Split into separate agents in Phase 2
```

#### Simplified Communication
- Direct PostgreSQL polling instead of Redis Streams
- Simple status updates instead of complex events
- No distributed transactions initially

#### Basic UI
- Single HTML page with HTMX for updates
- No complex state management
- Human approval via simple buttons

### 3.2 Quality Measurement Implementation

#### Fitness Function Evolution

**MVP Fitness (Weeks 1-6):**
```python
fitness = 0.6 * performance_score + 0.4 * novelty_score
# Simple, focused on core metrics
```

**Enhanced Fitness (Months 2-3):**
```python
fitness = weighted_sum(
    performance_score * 0.4,
    novelty_score * 0.3,
    robustness_score * 0.2,
    generalization_score * 0.1
)
```

**Adaptive Fitness (Months 4+):**
- ML model trained on human feedback
- Dynamic weight adjustment
- Market regime awareness

### 3.3 Testing Strategy

#### MVP Testing (Minimal but Critical)
- **Smoke Tests**: Can agents complete a full cycle?
- **Integration Tests**: KTRDR API interaction
- **Fitness Tests**: Are scores calculated correctly?

#### Phase 2 Testing (Comprehensive)
- **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage target
- **Workflow Tests**: LangGraph state machines
- **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput
- **Failure Tests**: Agent crash recovery

#### Phase 3 Testing (Production-Grade)
- **Chaos Engineering**: Random agent failures
- **Load Testing**: 100+ concurrent experiments
- **Security Testing**: API penetration tests
- **Disaster Recovery**: Full system restore

### 3.4 Deployment Progression

#### Local Development (Weeks 1-2)
```bash
# Simple docker-compose for development
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
python -m research_agent.main  # Direct execution
```

#### Single Machine (Weeks 3-6)
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for MVP
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
  
  research_agent:
    build: .
    depends_on: [postgres]
    environment:
      - HUMAN_APPROVAL=required
```

#### Docker Swarm (Months 2-3)
```bash
# Single machine swarm
docker swarm init
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml research
```

#### Distributed Swarm (Months 4+)
```bash
# Multi-machine deployment
docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>
docker node update --label-add type=compute node2
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack-distributed.yml research
```

## 8. Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a pragmatic path from concept to autonomous AI research system. By starting with a simplified two-agent MVP and progressively adding complexity, we can validate the core value proposition within 6 weeks while maintaining a clear path to the full vision.

The key to success is maintaining focus on the central question: **Can AI agents discover novel trading insights?** Every implementation decision should be evaluated against this criterion, with complexity added only when it demonstrably improves research quality.

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize PostgreSQL schema design
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Week 1 implementation
