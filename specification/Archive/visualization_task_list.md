## Conclusion

This task list covers the full implementation of the visualization subsystem using TradingView's lightweight-charts library. The work is organized into logical phases that build upon each other, starting with the core framework and progressively adding more advanced features.

The estimated timeline for full implementation is 8-12 days, with a basic working version available after 5-7 days. This approach ensures we can deliver incremental value while building toward a complete solution.

Key deliverables will include:
1. A Python API for creating financial charts
2. Support for multiple chart types and indicators
3. Flexible layout options
4. Integration with KTRDR's data and indicator systems
5. Complete documentation and examples
