# Multi-Timeframe Testing Plan

## üß™ **Incremental Multi-Timeframe Testing Strategy**

### **Test Plan Philosophy**
- **Start simple, add complexity gradually**
- **Test at each layer of the stack independently**
- **Use real data and real training runs** (not just imports)
- **Verify data integrity at each step**
- **Test failure scenarios, not just happy paths**

### **Available Data**
Based on `/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/data/`:
- **TSLA**: `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `1d` (excellent for multi-timeframe testing)
- **AAPL**: `1h`, `1d` (good for simple dual timeframe tests)
- **MSFT**: `1h`, `1d` (backup option)
- **EURUSD**: `5m`, `1h`, `1d` (forex testing)

## **üö® CRITICAL BUGS DISCOVERED & FIXED**

### **Bug 1: CLI Polling Undefined Variable**
- **Error**: `name 'data' is not defined` during training status polling
- **Root Cause**: Variable name mismatch in error handling (`data` vs `operation_data`)
- **Impact**: CLI crashes when training fails
- **Fix**: Use correct variable name `operation_data.get("error", "Unknown error")`
- **Location**: `ktrdr/cli/model_commands.py` line 345

### **Bug 2: Multi-Timeframe Refactoring Regression**
- **Error**: `'dict' object has no attribute 'isna'`
- **Root Cause**: Multi-timeframe refactoring changed return types from DataFrame to Dict but single-timeframe NaN checking wasn't updated
- **Impact**: Single-timeframe training completely broken
- **Fix**: Add isinstance() checks for both single DataFrame and Dict cases
- **Locations**: 
  - `ktrdr/training/train_strategy.py` line 95 (indicators)
  - `ktrdr/training/train_strategy.py` line 120 (fuzzy data)

### **Bug 3: Small Dataset Label Imbalance**
- **Error**: 0% test accuracy despite 61% validation accuracy
- **Root Cause**: Chronological data split with small time window (2 weeks) created test set with only one label class
- **Impact**: Test evaluation completely unreliable
- **Fix**: Use minimum 1 month date ranges for proper label distribution
- **Learning**: Time series labeling creates temporal clustering that requires larger datasets

### **Bug 4: Data Coverage Issues**
- **Error**: "Loaded 0 bars of data" - training fails immediately
- **Root Cause**: TSLA 1h data only covers 2025, test used 2024 dates
- **Impact**: Training fails before starting
- **Fix**: Use AAPL (excellent 2020-2025 coverage) and verify data ranges
- **Learning**: Always verify data coverage before testing

---

## **Phase 1: Single Timeframe Baseline**
**Goal**: Verify single timeframe still works exactly as before

### Setup
```bash
# Create a single timeframe test strategy
cp strategies/neuro_mean_reversion.yaml strategies/test_single_1h.yaml
```

**Edit `strategies/test_single_1h.yaml`**:
```yaml
# Change these lines:
training_data:
  symbols:
    mode: "single"
    symbol: "TSLA"  # Simple single symbol
  timeframes:
    mode: "single" 
    timeframe: "1h"  # Just 1h timeframe
```

### Test Command
```bash
# Use 1 month minimum for proper label distribution
ktrdr models train strategies/test_single_1h.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED**
**Small date ranges cause test failure!** Using 2 weeks (Jan 1-15) resulted in:
- Test data with only 1 class (100% HOLD labels)  
- 0% test accuracy due to class imbalance
- **Solution**: Use minimum 1 month date ranges for proper label distribution

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Check data loading output**: Look for "Loaded X bars of data for 1h"
2. **Check feature count**: Look for "Created X features from Y components" 
3. **Expected features**: Should be around 6-10 features (RSI: 3 fuzzy sets, MACD: 3 fuzzy sets, plus lookback)

### How to Spot Check Indicators
```bash
# After training, check the logs for:
# "Calculated 2 indicators" (RSI + MACD)
# No error messages about NaN values
# Training loss should decrease over epochs
```

### üîç **Debug When Test Metrics = 0%**
If you see 0% test accuracy, add debug logging to `_evaluate_model()`:
```python
print(f"Debug: Test labels unique values: {torch.unique(y_test)}")
print(f"Debug: Predictions unique values: {torch.unique(predicted)}")
```
Look for:
- Test labels with only one class (e.g., `tensor([1])`)
- Model predicting different class (e.g., `tensor([0])`)
- **Solution**: Use larger date range for better label distribution

### What to Watch For
- Training should complete without errors
- Feature count should be reasonable (6-15 features)
- Loss should decrease from ~1.0 to <0.5
- Training time under 2-3 minutes for this small dataset

---

## **Phase 2: Simple Two Timeframe Test**
**Goal**: Test basic multi-timeframe with two timeframes

### Setup
```bash
cp strategies/test_single_1h.yaml strategies/test_dual_1h_1d.yaml
```

**Edit `strategies/test_dual_1h_1d.yaml`**:
```yaml
training_data:
  timeframes:
    mode: "multi_timeframe"
    list: ["1h", "1d"]
    base_timeframe: "1h"
```

### Test Command
```bash
# Use 1 month minimum (lesson from Phase 1)
ktrdr models train strategies/test_dual_1h_1d.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose
```

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Check multi-timeframe output**: Look for "Multi-timeframe training enabled: 1h, 1d"
2. **Check data loading**: Look for "Loaded X total bars across 2 timeframes"
3. **Check feature explosion**: Features should be ~2x single timeframe (12-20 features)

### How to Verify Data Sync
```bash
# Look in logs for:
# "Timeframes: 1h, 1d" 
# No errors about data alignment
# Feature names should include prefixes like "1h_rsi_oversold", "1d_rsi_oversold"
```

### What to Watch For
- Feature count roughly doubles (if single was 8, this should be ~16)
- No "data alignment" or "synchronization" errors
- Training still converges (might be slower)
- Memory usage increase but should remain reasonable

---

## **Phase 3: Data Quality Deep Dive**
**Goal**: Verify data synchronization and alignment makes sense

### Test Command
```bash
# Use 1 month for data quality analysis (lesson from Phase 1)
ktrdr models train strategies/test_dual_1h_1d.yaml --start-date 2024-02-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 --verbose
```

### Manual Verification
1. **Check your raw data files**:
```bash
# Look at the actual data files
head -20 data/TSLA_1h.csv
head -20 data/TSLA_1d.csv
```

2. **Verify date alignment**: 
   - 1h data on 2024-02-01 09:30 should align with 1d data on 2024-02-01
   - Make sure no weekend/holiday misalignment

### How to Spot Check
- Training should mention "2-3 days" worth of data
- 1h should have ~48-72 bars (24 hours √ó 2-3 days, accounting for market hours)
- 1d should have 2-3 bars
- No warnings about "insufficient data"

### What to Watch For
- Off-by-one errors in timestamp alignment
- Data from different timeframes not representing the same market state
- NaN propagation across timeframes
- Warnings about missing data or gaps

---

## **Phase 4: Feature Engineering Validation**
**Goal**: Ensure features combine sensibly and names are clear

### Setup
```bash
cp strategies/neuro_mean_reversion.yaml strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml
```

**Edit `strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml`**:
```yaml
training_data:
  symbols:
    mode: "single"
    symbol: "AAPL"  # AAPL has both 1h and 1d data
  timeframes:
    mode: "multi_timeframe"
    list: ["1h", "1d"]  # Use the data you have
```

### Test Command
```bash
# Use 1 month minimum (lesson from Phase 1)
ktrdr models train strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose
```

### Manual Verification
1. **Feature count check**: Should be ~12-18 features (6-9 per timeframe)
2. **Look for feature names** in logs mentioning "1h_" and "1d_" prefixes
3. **Check model architecture**: Should adapt to new feature count

### What to Watch For
- Feature count explosion (>50 features might be too much)
- Missing timeframe prefixes in feature names
- NaN warnings in fuzzy membership generation
- Features that don't make logical sense together
- Scaling issues between timeframes

---

## **Phase 5: Training Stability Test**
**Goal**: Ensure training is reproducible and stable

### Test Commands (run 3 times)
```bash
# Use 1 month minimum for all runs (lesson from Phase 1)
# Run 1
ktrdr models train strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose

# Run 2 (same exact command)
ktrdr models train strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose

# Run 3 (same exact command)  
ktrdr models train strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-02-01 --verbose
```

### Manual Verification
1. **Compare final accuracies**: Should be within 5-10% of each other
2. **Check feature importance**: Top features should be similar across runs
3. **Training time**: Should be consistent

### What to Watch For
- High variance between runs (suggesting instability)
- Exploding/vanishing gradients
- Nonsensical feature importance (e.g., 1d features dominating when they shouldn't)
- Widely different convergence patterns

---

## **Phase 6: Edge Cases and Stress Testing**
**Goal**: Test boundary conditions and failure scenarios

### Test 1 - Missing Data Scenario
```bash
# Test with a symbol that doesn't have all requested timeframes
cp strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml strategies/test_edge_missing_data.yaml
```

**Edit `strategies/test_edge_missing_data.yaml`**:
```yaml
training_data:
  symbols:
    mode: "single"
    symbol: "EURUSD"  # Has 5m, 1h, 1d but NOT 4h
  timeframes:
    mode: "multi_timeframe"
    list: ["1h", "4h"]  # 4h doesn't exist for EURUSD
```

### Test 2 - Very Different Timeframes
```bash
cp strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml strategies/test_extreme_timeframes.yaml
```

**Edit `strategies/test_extreme_timeframes.yaml`**:
```yaml
training_data:
  symbols:
    mode: "single"
    symbol: "TSLA"  # Has 15m and 1d data
  timeframes:
    mode: "multi_timeframe"
    list: ["15m", "1d"]  # Very different time scales
```

### Test 3 - Memory Pressure Test
```bash
# Test with 3 month range to stress memory (larger than minimum 1 month)
ktrdr models train strategies/test_features_aapl.yaml --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-04-01 --verbose
```

### What to Watch For in Edge Cases
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Appropriate error messages for unavailable timeframes
- Memory usage spikes with many timeframes
- Performance degradation with extreme timeframe differences

## **Quick Action Items**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Create `test_single_1h.yaml` and verify baseline
2. **Run each phase sequentially** - Don't skip ahead if earlier phases fail
3. **Watch console output carefully** - The logs tell you what's happening
4. **Stop if anything looks weird** - Better to catch issues early
5. **Document any unexpected behavior** - This helps improve the system

## **Emergency Stop Criteria**

**Stop testing and investigate if you see**:
- Memory usage >8GB during training
- Training time >15 minutes for small datasets
- Feature counts >100
- Consistent NaN warnings
- Training accuracy <20% (worse than random)
- Crashes or Python exceptions

---

**Remember**: The goal is to catch real issues before they become bigger problems. Take your time with each phase and actually look at the outputs!
