## Document Principles

All ADRs follow these principles:
- **Accuracy**: Reflect actual implementation status, not aspirational goals
- **Audience**: Developer (user) and LLMs (Claude, Claude Code)
- **Structure**: Context, Decision, Consequences, Implementation status
- **Detail Level**: Include code examples, schemas, and clear integration points
- **Modularity**: Each ADR is self-contained but references related documents
- **Evolution**: Documents updated to match implementation reality

## Notes

- **Last Accuracy Audit**: January 2025 - Comprehensive verification against codebase
- **Implementation Gap**: ADRs 2,3,4,5 were originally specs but are now largely implemented
- **Technical Debt**: 83 TODO/FIXME markers identified (ADR-008) - manageable level
- **Next Review**: March 2025 or when significant architectural changes occur
