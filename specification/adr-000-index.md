## MVP Scope

Based on the product roadmap, the MVP focuses on:
1. **ADR-001** âœ… - Understanding current system
2. **ADR-003** âœ… - Neuro-fuzzy strategy framework  
3. **ADR-004** ðŸ”„ - Training system (needed for creating models)
4. **ADR-005** ðŸ”„ - Backtesting system (needed for strategy validation)

Post-MVP priorities:
- **ADR-002** - Complete decision engine architecture
- **ADR-007** - Paper trading for live validation
- **ADR-008** - Risk management for capital protection

## Document Principles

All ADRs follow these principles:
- **Audience**: Developer (user) and LLMs (Claude, Claude Code)
- **Structure**: Context, Decision, Consequences, Implementation examples
- **Detail Level**: Include code examples, schemas, and clear integration points
- **Modularity**: Each ADR is self-contained but references related documents
- **Evolution**: Documents can be updated as implementation provides new insights

## Notes

- This index will be updated as new ADRs are created or existing ones are modified
- Each ADR should reference this index (ADR-000) for context
- Priority and status will be adjusted based on project progress and learnings
