You are helping implement a real trading research frontend called **KTRDR**, built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Redux. The architecture has been refactored to eliminate artificial demo pages and now follows a clean, feature-based folder structure with true vertical slicing.

The app is already wired to a working backend API. The existing ‚ÄúData Selection‚Äù tab demonstrates how to fetch API data correctly. That approach must be reused.

Your job is to implement one task at a time, where each task represents a vertical, user-facing product slice.

## üîß Key Implementation Rules

1. **Use existing architecture**:
   - React + TypeScript
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Redux Toolkit where global state is needed
   - React Router for routing
   - Sidebar-driven navigation layout (`MainLayout`)

2. **Vertical slicing only**:
   - Each task must result in a usable UI feature, not an isolated demo
   - Avoid artificial examples, factories, or placeholder logic

3. **Fetch data using existing methods**:
   - Use the exact same data fetching approach already implemented in the **Data Selection tab**
   - That includes using existing fetch clients, request utilities, and typing patterns
   - ‚ùå Do **not** invent new fetch layers or use libraries like SWR or RTK Query

4. **Follow feature-based folder structure**:
   - Organize files under `features/<domain>`, `api/`, and `pages/`
   - Shared UI components go in `components/`
   - Reusable logic (like indicator data) can go into `hooks/` if needed

5. **Keep code clean and idiomatic**:
   - Prefer simple, readable logic over abstract ‚Äúhelper layers‚Äù
   - Minimize unnecessary wrappers
   - Use clear prop types and descriptive variable names

## ‚úÖ What to return

- Full code for all new/updated files
- Any API integration (requests, hooks, data validation)
- Routing or navigation updates if needed
- A brief explanation of how your code works and why it follows the architecture
