  text: Multi-timeframe (5m with 1h context) might break the 64.8% plateau
  source_experiment: exp_v15_rsi_zigzag_1_5
  rationale: Single timeframe seems to be a ceiling. Best result is 64.2% on 1h. Adding
    context from a lower timeframe (5m) aligned with 1h bars might capture intra-bar
    momentum that the 1h data misses.

  text: ADX might work as a trend filter when combined with RSI
  source_experiment: exp_v15_adx_only
  rationale: ADX solo showed no signal (50% test accuracy), but it measures trend
    strength. RSI works well for reversals. ADX > 25 might filter RSI signals to only
    take trades in trending markets.

  text: LSTM/attention architecture might capture RSI trajectories better than MLP
  source_experiment: exp_v15_rsi_zigzag_1_5
  rationale: Current MLP sees RSI values but not the trajectory (rising vs falling).
    LSTM or attention could capture temporal patterns like 'RSI rising from oversold'
    vs 'RSI falling into oversold', which may have different predictive value.

  text: Training on multiple symbols might improve generalization
  source_experiment: exp_v15_rsi_zigzag_1_5
  rationale: All v1.5 experiments were on EURUSD only. Training on a portfolio of
    forex pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY) might help the model learn more generalizable
    patterns rather than EURUSD-specific quirks.

  text: Zigzag threshold should scale with timeframe
  source_experiment: exp_v15_rsi_zigzag_3_5
  rationale: Zigzag 3.5% on 1h caused severe overfitting (15.8pp gap), but 1.5% worked
    well. On 1d data with larger moves, a higher threshold might be appropriate. The
    optimal threshold may be proportional to typical bar range at each timeframe.

  text: Stochastic + Williams %R combination might match RSI performance
  source_experiment: exp_v15_stochastic_only
  rationale: 'Stochastic solo achieved 59.7% (weak signal). Williams %R solo: 59.1%.
    Both measure momentum differently. Combining them might capture momentum confirmation
    patterns that approach RSI''s 61-64% range.'
