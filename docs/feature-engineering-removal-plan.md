# KTRDR Feature Engineering Removal Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete plan to remove the FeatureEngineer component from KTRDR and transition to a pure neuro-fuzzy architecture. The goal is to eliminate the current mixed approach (fuzzy + raw features) and implement a clean pipeline where neural networks receive only fuzzy membership values.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 What Feature Engineering Currently Does

The FeatureEngineer component creates 37 features:
- **9 fuzzy memberships** (already perfect for neural networks)
- **28 raw engineered features** (mathematical calculations that bypass fuzzy logic)

### 1.2 The Problem

The current architecture violates neuro-fuzzy principles:
1. **Mixed inputs**: Neural network receives both semantic fuzzy values (0-1) and raw calculations (unbounded)
2. **Architectural inconsistency**: System is marketed as "neuro-fuzzy" but actually hybrid
3. **Multi-symbol barriers**: Raw features use hardcoded parameters that don't work across asset classes
4. **Complex scaling**: Different feature types require different scaling approaches

### 1.3 Dependencies to Remove

**Code Dependencies:**
- `ktrdr/training/train_strategy.py:12` - Direct import
- `ktrdr/neural/models/mlp.py:80` - Circular dependency for inference
- `ktrdr/training/model_storage.py:34,79-81` - Scaler storage
- 15+ test files and scripts

**Conceptual Dependencies:**
- Feature scaling logic (fuzzy values don't need scaling)
- Feature importance calculations (optional for fuzzy)
- Mixed feature type handling

## 2. Target Architecture

### 2.1 Pure Neuro-Fuzzy Pipeline

```
Market Data → Indicators → Fuzzy Engine → Neural Network
```

**Key Principles:**
1. **All neural inputs are fuzzy memberships** (0-1 values with semantic meaning)
2. **No feature engineering layer** between fuzzy engine and neural network
3. **Standard technical indicators** replace ad-hoc calculations
4. **Universal features** that work across all symbols and asset classes

### 2.2 Enhanced Indicator Set

Replace raw feature calculations with proper technical indicators:

| Current Raw Feature | Standard Indicator | Implementation Status |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `price_to_sma_20_ratio` | Distance from MA | **Need to create** |
| `roc_5`, `roc_10`, `roc_20` | ROC Indicator | ✅ **Exists** |
| `daily_price_position` | Williams %R | ✅ **Exists** |
| `volatility_20` | ATR | ✅ **Exists** |
| `volume_ratio_20` | Volume Ratio | ✅ **Exists** |
| `volume_change_5` | Money Flow Index | ✅ **Exists** |
| `obv_normalized` | Chaikin Money Flow | ✅ **Exists** |

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Phase 1: Create Missing Indicator (2 days)

**Goal:** Implement the only missing standard indicator

**Task:** Create `DistanceFromMAIndicator`
- **Formula:** `(Close - MovingAverage) / MovingAverage * 100`
- **Output:** Percentage distance from MA (-50% to +50% typical range)
- **Benefits:** Standard technical analysis approach vs ad-hoc ratio

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. Create indicator class following KTRDR patterns
2. Support both SMA and EMA
3. Register in indicator factory
4. Add parameter validation schema
5. Write unit tests

**Integration Points:**
- Must work with existing indicator engine
- Must output single column for fuzzy processing
- Must handle edge cases (zero MA values)

### 3.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Strategy Configuration (1 day)

**Goal:** Define comprehensive fuzzy sets for all indicators

**Current Fuzzy Coverage:** 3 indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA) with 9 fuzzy sets
**Target Fuzzy Coverage:** ~10 indicators with fuzzy sets

**New Fuzzy Sets Required:**
```yaml
# Distance from Moving Averages
dma_sma: [far_below, below, near, above, far_above]
dma_ema: [far_below, below, near, above, far_above]

# Momentum (using existing ROC)
momentum_short: [strong_down, down, flat, up, strong_up]
momentum_medium: [strong_down, down, flat, up, strong_up]
momentum_long: [strong_down, down, flat, up, strong_up]

# Intraday Position (Williams %R)
intraday_position: [oversold, weak, middle, strong, overbought]

# Volatility (ATR)
volatility: [very_low, low, medium, high, very_high]

# Volume Analysis
volume_strength: [very_weak, weak, normal, strong, very_strong]
volume_momentum: [oversold, weak, neutral, strong, overbought]
money_flow: [strong_selling, selling, neutral, buying, strong_buying]
```

**Critical Considerations:**
- Fuzzy set parameters must be asset-class agnostic
- Overlapping triangular functions for smooth transitions
- Conservative ranges to avoid overfitting

### 3.3 Phase 3: Direct Fuzzy Processing (3 days)

**Goal:** Replace FeatureEngineer with direct fuzzy → neural pipeline

**3.3.1 Create FuzzyNeuralProcessor**
- **Purpose:** Convert fuzzy DataFrame directly to neural tensor
- **Input:** Pure fuzzy memberships (0-1 values)
- **Output:** Neural network ready tensor
- **Features:** Optional temporal (lagged) fuzzy values

**3.3.2 Update Training Pipeline**
Replace in `train_strategy.py`:
```python
# OLD: Mixed feature engineering
features, feature_names, scaler = FeatureEngineer().prepare_features(...)

# NEW: Direct fuzzy processing  
features, feature_names = FuzzyNeuralProcessor().prepare_input(fuzzy_data)
```

**3.3.3 Update Model Inference**
Replace in `mlp.py`:
```python
# OLD: Circular dependency
from ...training.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineer

# NEW: Direct fuzzy processing
features = self._process_fuzzy_input(fuzzy_data)
```

**Integration Challenges:**
- Temporal features (lagged fuzzy values) need strategy-specific configuration
- Feature count changes from 37 to 50+ (model architecture impact)
- No feature scaling (fuzzy values are already 0-1)

### 3.4 Phase 4: Model Storage Simplification (2 days)

**Goal:** Remove feature engineering artifacts from model storage

**Changes Required:**
1. **Remove scaler storage** - fuzzy values don't need scaling
2. **Simplify feature metadata** - just fuzzy column names
3. **Update model loading** - no scaler dependencies
4. **Version model format** - distinguish pure fuzzy models

**Storage Schema Changes:**
```python
# OLD: Mixed feature metadata
{
  "feature_names": [...37 mixed features...],
  "feature_importance": {...},
  "scaler": "scaler.pkl"
}

# NEW: Pure fuzzy metadata
{
  "fuzzy_features": [...50+ fuzzy features...],
  "temporal_config": {"periods": 2, "enabled": true},
  "model_version": "pure_fuzzy_v1"
}
```

**Backward Compatibility Strategy:**
- Maintain model format versioning
- Clear deprecation path for mixed-feature models

### 3.5 Phase 5: Complete Removal (2 days)

**Goal:** Delete all FeatureEngineer code and validate system

**Files to Delete:**
- `ktrdr/training/feature_engineering.py`
- `ktrdr/neural/feature_engineering.py`
- `ktrdr/training/multi_timeframe_feature_engineering.py`
- `tests/neural/test_feature_engineering.py`
- Related test files and imports

**Critical Validation:**
1. **No circular dependencies** remain in codebase
2. **All imports resolved** after deletion
3. **Training pipeline works** end-to-end
4. **Model inference works** without FeatureEngineer
5. **Performance maintained** (accuracy within 5% of baseline)

## 4. Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### 4.1 Low Risk: Integration Issues

**Risk:** New indicator or pipeline breaks during integration
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Low

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Comprehensive testing** - Unit, integration, end-to-end tests
2. **Gradual rollout** - Test one component at a time
3. **Version control** - Easy rollback capability
4. **Monitoring** - Log all training/inference operations

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1 Unit Testing

**New Components:**
- `DistanceFromMAIndicator` - calculation accuracy, edge cases
- `FuzzyNeuralProcessor` - tensor conversion, temporal features
- Updated model storage - save/load without scaler

**Regression Testing:**
- All existing indicators still work
- Fuzzy engine output unchanged
- Neural network training loop functional

### 5.2 Integration Testing

**End-to-End Pipeline:**
1. Strategy config → Indicators → Fuzzy → Neural → Model
2. Model loading → Inference → Predictions
3. Multi-symbol training capability

**Performance Testing:**
- Training speed with 50+ features vs 37 features
- Memory usage during training and inference  
- Model accuracy on validation datasets

### 5.3 Validation Testing

**Equivalence Testing:**
- Distance from MA values match old price ratios
- Williams %R captures old daily position patterns
- MFI/CMF improve upon old volume calculations

**Business Logic Testing:**
- Fuzzy memberships make trading sense
- Model predictions remain reasonable
- Strategy performance maintained
