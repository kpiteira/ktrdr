```

**Real Implementation Working**:
1. Load strategy configuration and trained models
2. Coordinate data pipeline (DataManager, IndicatorEngine, FuzzyEngine)
3. Prepare decision context with position state and market data
4. Generate neural network-based trading decisions
5. Apply risk management and mode-specific logic
6. Track position state and decision history

### ‚úÖ Integration Success

#### With Training System (ADR-004)
