# SLICE 3: TRAINING SERVICE DUMMY PATTERN INTEGRATION

**Branch**: `slice-3-training-dummy-pattern-integration`
**Goal**: Transform TrainingManager to follow DummyService pattern exactly, eliminating ALL async complexity like DataManager did
**Priority**: High
**Depends on**: Slice 1 and 2 completion

## ðŸŽ¯ **DUMMY SERVICE PATTERN ADOPTION**

**CRITICAL**: This slice **MUST** follow the DummyService pattern exactly as demonstrated in `ktrdr/api/services/dummy_service.py` and successfully applied to DataManager.

**Key Requirements**:
- TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] exactly like DataManager
- ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL async complexity (zero boilerplate in TrainingManager)
- Training methods become single `start_managed_operation()` calls like DummyService
- Perfect UX with smooth progress and instant cancellation through ServiceOrchestrator
- Clean domain logic with ServiceOrchestrator's unified cancellation system
- Training operations provide structured progress (eliminate 50+ lines of CLI string parsing)

**Integration Points**:
- TrainingManager â†’ ServiceOrchestrator (inherits ALL capabilities)
- Training methods â†’ `start_managed_operation()` calls (like DummyService.start_dummy_task())
- Domain logic â†’ `_run_training_async()` methods (like DummyService._run_dummy_task_async())
- ServiceOrchestrator â†’ Handles operations, progress, cancellation automatically
- CLI â†’ Gets structured progress data (no more string parsing)

## Overview

This slice transforms TrainingManager to follow the exact DummyService pattern that has been successfully applied to DataManager. This eliminates ALL async complexity from TrainingManager and provides the same perfect UX as DummyService.

**KEY INSIGHT**: DummyService shows the "most awesome yet simple" async service pattern. TrainingManager should be just as simple - ServiceOrchestrator handles everything, TrainingManager just calls `start_managed_operation()`.

**Current Problem**: TrainingManager lacks ServiceOrchestrator inheritance, so:
- No structured progress â†’ CLI needs 50+ lines of brittle string parsing
- No unified cancellation â†’ Training continues after cancellation requests
- Manual async management â†’ Complex, error-prone code
- Inconsistent with DataManager â†’ Different patterns across the codebase

**SOLUTION**: Make TrainingManager inherit ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] and follow DummyService pattern exactly:
- ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL complexity automatically
- Training methods become simple `start_managed_operation()` calls
- Domain logic in clean `_run_*_async()` methods with cancellation support
- Perfect UX with zero effort, just like DummyService

## Success Criteria

- [ ] TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] exactly like DataManager
- [ ] TrainingManager methods become single `start_managed_operation()` calls like DummyService
- [ ] Training domain logic in clean `_run_*_async()` methods with ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
- [ ] TrainingProgressRenderer provides training-specific structured progress context
- [ ] Training CLI gets structured progress data (eliminate 50+ lines of string parsing)
- [ ] Training operations have perfect UX - smooth progress and instant cancellation
- [ ] ALL existing training functionality preserved with zero boilerplate
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL async complexity automatically
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Training follows exact same pattern as DummyService (consistency)

## Current Architecture Issue

**DummyService (perfect reference)**:
- Inherits ServiceOrchestrator[None] â†’ ALL complexity handled automatically
- Methods are single `start_managed_operation()` calls â†’ zero boilerplate
- Domain logic in `_run_dummy_task_async()` â†’ clean, focused implementation
- Perfect UX with instant cancellation and smooth progress â†’ effortless

**DataManager (successfully refactored)**:
- Inherits ServiceOrchestrator[IbDataAdapter] â†’ follows DummyService pattern
- Has `load_data_async()` method â†’ single `start_managed_operation()` call
- Domain logic in `_run_data_load_async()` â†’ clean implementation like DummyService
- CLI gets structured progress via ServiceOrchestrator â†’ no string parsing

**TrainingManager (needs transformation)**:
- Plain class (no ServiceOrchestrator) â†’ manual async management
- Direct TrainingAdapter calls â†’ no operations tracking or structured progress
- CLI gets unstructured strings â†’ 50+ lines of brittle parsing logic
- No unified cancellation â†’ training continues after cancellation requests

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Transform TrainingManager to Follow DummyService Pattern Exactly

**Description**: Transform TrainingManager to inherit ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] and implement the exact DummyService pattern, eliminating ALL async complexity.

**Why this is needed**: TrainingManager currently lacks ServiceOrchestrator inheritance, causing:
- Manual async management (complex, error-prone)
- No structured progress (CLI needs 50+ lines of string parsing)
- No unified cancellation (training continues after cancellation)
- Inconsistent with DataManager and DummyService patterns

**DummyService Pattern to Follow**:
```python
# DummyService shows the perfect pattern:
class DummyService(ServiceOrchestrator[None]):
    async def start_dummy_task(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # ServiceOrchestrator handles EVERYTHING - one method call!
        return await self.start_managed_operation(
            operation_name="dummy_task",
            operation_type="DUMMY",
            operation_func=self._run_dummy_task_async,
        )

    async def _run_dummy_task_async(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Clean domain logic with ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
        cancellation_token = self.get_current_cancellation_token()
        # ... domain logic with cancellation support
```

**TrainingManager Transformation**:
```python
# BEFORE: Plain class with manual async management
class TrainingManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.training_adapter = self._initialize_training_adapter()

    async def train_multi_symbol_strategy(self, ...):
        # Direct adapter call - no operations tracking, no cancellation
        return await self.training_adapter.train_multi_symbol_strategy(...)

# AFTER: ServiceOrchestrator inheritance following DummyService pattern
class TrainingManager(ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter]):
    def _initialize_adapter(self) -> TrainingAdapter:
        # Same initialization logic, moved to ServiceOrchestrator pattern
        return TrainingAdapter(...)

    async def train_multi_symbol_strategy_async(self, ...) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # ServiceOrchestrator handles EVERYTHING - one method call like DummyService!
        return await self.start_managed_operation(
            operation_name="train_multi_symbol_strategy",
            operation_type="TRAINING",
            operation_func=self._run_training_async,
            # Pass parameters to domain logic
            strategy_config_path=strategy_config_path,
            symbols=symbols,
            timeframes=timeframes,
            # ... other parameters
        )

    async def _run_training_async(self, ...) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Clean domain logic like DummyService._run_dummy_task_async()
        cancellation_token = self.get_current_cancellation_token()

        # Use existing TrainingAdapter with ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
        result = await self.training_adapter.train_multi_symbol_strategy(
            ...,
            cancellation_token=cancellation_token,
            progress_callback=self.update_operation_progress,
        )

        # Format API response like DataManager does
        return self._format_training_api_response(result)
```

**What ServiceOrchestrator Provides Automatically**:
- Operation creation & tracking via operations service
- Progress reporting integration with TrainingProgressRenderer
- Unified cancellation support coordination
- API response formatting for CLI compatibility
- Background task execution management
- Environment variable configuration support

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] exactly like DataManager
- [ ] Training methods become single `start_managed_operation()` calls like DummyService
- [ ] Domain logic in clean `_run_*_async()` methods with ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
- [ ] Environment configuration maintained (USE_TRAINING_HOST_SERVICE) via ServiceOrchestrator
- [ ] ALL existing functionality preserved with zero boilerplate
- [ ] ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL async complexity automatically
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Perfect UX with smooth progress and instant cancellation like DummyService

### Task 3.2: Create TrainingProgressRenderer Following DataProgressRenderer Pattern

**Description**: Create TrainingProgressRenderer following the exact same pattern as DataProgressRenderer to provide structured progress context for training operations via ServiceOrchestrator.

**Why this is needed**: ServiceOrchestrator needs a training-specific progress renderer to provide structured progress context, eliminating the 50+ lines of CLI string parsing. This renderer integrates with ServiceOrchestrator's progress system automatically.

**Key Insight**: Just like DataProgressRenderer provides structured context for data operations, TrainingProgressRenderer will provide structured context for training operations. ServiceOrchestrator calls the renderer automatically - no manual integration needed.

**Progress Format Examples**:
- Single symbol: "Training MLP model on AAPL [1H] [epoch 15/50] (batch 342/500)"
- Multi-symbol: "Training MLP model on AAPL, MSFT (+2 more) [1H, 4H] [epoch 15/50]"
- Different models: "Training CNN model on TSLA [5m] [epoch 8/20] (batch 156/800)"

**ServiceOrchestrator Integration**:
```python
# ServiceOrchestrator automatically calls renderer with context updates
class TrainingProgressRenderer(ProgressRenderer):
    def render_progress_message(self, context: dict) -> str:
        # Extract training-specific context
        model_type = context.get('model_type', 'Model')
        symbols = context.get('symbols', [])
        timeframes = context.get('timeframes', [])
        current_epoch = context.get('current_epoch', 0)
        total_epochs = context.get('total_epochs', 0)

        # Format like: "Training MLP model on AAPL [1H] [epoch 15/50]"
        return self._format_training_context(model_type, symbols, timeframes, current_epoch, total_epochs)

# TrainingManager domain logic updates context
async def _run_training_async(self, ...) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # ServiceOrchestrator provides progress updates automatically
    self.update_operation_progress(
        step=current_step,
        message=f"Training epoch {current_epoch}",
        context={
            'model_type': 'mlp',
            'symbols': symbols,
            'timeframes': timeframes,
            'current_epoch': current_epoch,
            'total_epochs': total_epochs,
            'current_batch': current_batch,
            'total_batches': total_batches,
        }
    )
```

**Context Structure**:
- Model type (MLP, CNN, LSTM, etc.) - extracted from strategy config
- Symbols being trained (with smart truncation for multi-symbol readability)
- Timeframes (with smart truncation for multi-timeframe readability)
- Epoch progress (coarse-grained) - current/total epochs
- Batch progress (fine-grained) - current/total batches within epoch
- Step progress from ServiceOrchestrator - overall operation progress

**Integration with ServiceOrchestrator**:
- TrainingManager passes TrainingProgressRenderer to ServiceOrchestrator constructor
- ServiceOrchestrator calls renderer automatically during progress updates
- CLI gets structured progress data from operations API (no string parsing)
- Same pattern as DataProgressRenderer for consistency

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TrainingProgressRenderer extends ProgressRenderer interface like DataProgressRenderer
- [ ] Integrates with ServiceOrchestrator progress system automatically
- [ ] Renders training context clearly and consistently for CLI display
- [ ] Handles multi-symbol/timeframe scenarios with smart truncation
- [ ] Provides both coarse (epoch) and fine (batch) progress information
- [ ] Context includes model type, symbols, timeframes, epochs, batches
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Follows exact same pattern as DataProgressRenderer (consistency)

### Task 3.3: Leverage ServiceOrchestrator's Automatic Cancellation for Training

**Description**: Configure TrainingAdapter and training components to use ServiceOrchestrator's automatic cancellation system, following the DummyService pattern for effortless cancellation support.

**Key Insight**: ServiceOrchestrator provides automatic cancellation support just like DummyService demonstrates. TrainingAdapter and training components just need to check `self.get_current_cancellation_token()` periodically - no manual cancellation infrastructure needed.

**DummyService Cancellation Pattern**:
```python
# DummyService shows perfect cancellation pattern:
async def _run_dummy_task_async(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    for i in range(iterations):
        # ServiceOrchestrator provides cancellation - just check it!
        cancellation_token = self.get_current_cancellation_token()
        if cancellation_token and cancellation_token.is_cancelled():
            return {"status": "cancelled", "iterations_completed": i}

        # Do work and report progress
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        self.update_operation_progress(step=i + 1, message=f"Working on iteration {i+1}")
```

**Why ServiceOrchestrator Cancellation is Better**:
- Automatic token management (no manual token passing)
- Unified cancellation protocol across all services
- Instant cancellation response through operations API
- Cross-thread communication built-in
- Perfect UX like DummyService demonstrates

**Training Implementation Strategy**:

**1. TrainingManager Domain Logic with ServiceOrchestrator Cancellation**:
```python
# TrainingManager._run_training_async() uses ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
async def _run_training_async(self, ...) -> dict[str, Any]:
    # Get cancellation token from ServiceOrchestrator (automatic!)
    cancellation_token = self.get_current_cancellation_token()

    # Pass token to TrainingAdapter
    result = await self.training_adapter.train_multi_symbol_strategy(
        ...,
        cancellation_token=cancellation_token,
        progress_callback=self.update_operation_progress
    )

    # ServiceOrchestrator handles cancellation gracefully in background
    return self._format_training_api_response(result)
```

**2. TrainingAdapter Updates for ServiceOrchestrator Cancellation**:
```python
# TrainingAdapter accepts cancellation_token from ServiceOrchestrator
async def train_multi_symbol_strategy(self, ..., cancellation_token=None, progress_callback=None):
    if self.use_host_service:
        # Host service integration (future enhancement)
        return await self._call_host_service_training(..., cancellation_token=cancellation_token)
    else:
        # Local training with ServiceOrchestrator cancellation
        return await self.local_trainer.train_multi_symbol_strategy(
            ...,
            cancellation_token=cancellation_token,
            progress_callback=progress_callback
        )
```

**3. Local Training Cancellation Integration**:
```python
# model_trainer.py - Check ServiceOrchestrator cancellation periodically
async def train_multi_symbol_strategy(self, ..., cancellation_token=None, progress_callback=None):
    for epoch in range(total_epochs):
        # Check cancellation at epoch boundaries (minimal overhead)
        if cancellation_token and cancellation_token.is_cancelled():
            logger.info(f"Training cancelled at epoch {epoch}")
            return {"status": "cancelled", "epochs_completed": epoch}

        # Training epoch logic
        for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(train_loader):
            # Check cancellation every 50 batches (balanced performance)
            if batch_idx % 50 == 0 and cancellation_token and cancellation_token.is_cancelled():
                logger.info(f"Training cancelled at epoch {epoch}, batch {batch_idx}")
                return {"status": "cancelled", "epochs_completed": epoch, "batches_completed": batch_idx}

            # Update progress via ServiceOrchestrator callback
            if progress_callback:
                progress_callback(
                    step=current_step,
                    message=f"Training epoch {epoch+1}",
                    context={
                        'current_epoch': epoch + 1,
                        'total_epochs': total_epochs,
                        'current_batch': batch_idx + 1,
                        'total_batches': len(train_loader)
                    }
                )

    return {"status": "success", "epochs_completed": total_epochs}
```

**Why This Approach is Better**:
- ServiceOrchestrator provides cancellation token automatically
- No manual token passing through complex call chains
- Cancellation checks use simple `.is_cancelled()` method
- Performance optimized (epoch boundaries + every 50 batches)
- Progress updates and cancellation checks combined for efficiency
- Same pattern as DummyService and DataManager

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TrainingManager gets cancellation token from ServiceOrchestrator automatically
- [ ] TrainingAdapter accepts cancellation_token parameter from ServiceOrchestrator
- [ ] Local training checks cancellation at epoch boundaries (minimal overhead)
- [ ] Local training checks cancellation every 50 batches (performance balance)
- [ ] Training returns appropriate status on cancellation ("cancelled", progress info)
- [ ] Host service training accepts cancellation context (future enhancement)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Cancellation checks don't impact training performance significantly
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Training stops within reasonable time (epoch boundary or 50 batches)

---

### Task 3.4: Leverage ServiceOrchestrator's Automatic Structured Progress for CLI

**Description**: Remove the 50+ lines of brittle string parsing from CLI training commands by leveraging ServiceOrchestrator's automatic structured progress data, just like DataManager and DummyService provide.

**Key Insight**: Once TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator, the CLI automatically gets structured progress data through the operations API. No manual CLI changes needed - ServiceOrchestrator provides this automatically.

**Current Problem**: CLI training commands contain 50+ lines of brittle string parsing because TrainingManager doesn't use ServiceOrchestrator:
```python
# async_model_commands.py:424-512 - BRITTLE STRING PARSING
if current_step and "Epoch:" in current_step and "Bars:" in current_step:
    try:
        epoch_part = current_step.split("Epoch:")[1].split(",")[0].strip()
        current_epoch = int(epoch_part)
        bars_part = current_step.split("Bars:")[1].strip()
        if bars_part and "(" in bars_part:
            bars_part = bars_part.split("(")[0].strip()
        # ... 40+ more lines of fragile parsing logic
    except (IndexError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
        current_epoch = 0  # Parsing failed
```

**ServiceOrchestrator Solution**: Once TrainingManager uses ServiceOrchestrator, CLI gets structured data automatically:
```python
# AFTER: ServiceOrchestrator provides structured context automatically
def display_training_progress(progress_info):
    # Get structured context from ServiceOrchestrator operations API
    context = progress_info.get("context", {})

    # Clean, reliable data access (no parsing!)
    current_epoch = context.get('current_epoch', 0)
    total_epochs = context.get('total_epochs', 0)
    current_batch = context.get('current_batch', 0)
    total_batches = context.get('total_batches', 0)
    model_type = context.get('model_type', 'Model')
    symbols = context.get('symbols', [])

    # Display formatted progress (no parsing errors possible)
    epoch_progress = f"[epoch {current_epoch}/{total_epochs}]" if total_epochs > 0 else ""
    batch_progress = f"(batch {current_batch}/{total_batches})" if total_batches > 0 else ""

    return f"Training {model_type} model {epoch_progress} {batch_progress}"
```

**How ServiceOrchestrator Makes This Automatic**:
1. TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator â†’ automatic operations API integration
2. Training domain logic calls `self.update_operation_progress()` â†’ structured context
3. TrainingProgressRenderer formats context â†’ clean display messages
4. CLI polls operations API â†’ gets structured progress data automatically
5. CLI displays progress â†’ no string parsing needed, just structured data access

**Benefits of ServiceOrchestrator Approach**:
- **Automatic**: No manual CLI modifications needed
- **Reliable**: No parsing errors or edge case failures
- **Consistent**: Same pattern as data loading CLI (DummyService proves this works)
- **Maintainable**: Easy to extend context without breaking CLI
- **Performance**: No complex regex operations or string manipulation

**Implementation Approach**:
1. TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator â†’ automatic structured progress
2. Remove string parsing logic from CLI training commands
3. Access structured context from operations API (like data commands do)
4. Format progress using clean structured data (no parsing failures)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TrainingManager provides structured progress via ServiceOrchestrator operations API
- [ ] Remove 50+ lines of string parsing from CLI training commands (async_model_commands.py:424-512)
- [ ] CLI accesses structured context from operations API (like data loading commands)
- [ ] Training progress display more reliable and consistent than string parsing
- [ ] CLI training progress quality matches data loading CLI exactly
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: No parsing errors or edge case failures (impossible with structured data)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Same automatic pattern as DummyService and DataManager (consistency)

### Task 3.5: Validate DummyService Pattern Implementation in Training

**Description**: Comprehensive validation that TrainingManager now follows the exact DummyService pattern, providing the same perfect UX as DummyService and DataManager.

**Why this validation is critical**: This slice transforms TrainingManager to follow the proven DummyService pattern. We need to validate that:
1. TrainingManager works exactly like DummyService (pattern consistency)
2. Training operations are as simple as DummyService operations (zero boilerplate)
3. Perfect UX achieved - smooth progress and instant cancellation (like DummyService)
4. CLI gets automatic structured progress (no manual integration needed)
5. All existing functionality preserved with ServiceOrchestrator benefits

**DummyService Pattern Validation**:
- **Pattern consistency**: TrainingManager follows DummyService structure exactly
- **Method simplicity**: Training methods are single `start_managed_operation()` calls
- **Domain logic**: Clean `_run_*_async()` methods like `DummyService._run_dummy_task_async()`
- **ServiceOrchestrator benefits**: Automatic operations, progress, cancellation
- **UX quality**: Perfect progress and cancellation like DummyService demonstrates

**Validation Focus Areas**:

1. **Pattern Validation**: TrainingManager structure matches DummyService exactly
2. **UX Validation**: Training operations have perfect UX like DummyService
3. **CLI Validation**: Automatic structured progress (no string parsing)
4. **Regression Validation**: All existing training functionality preserved
5. **Performance Validation**: ServiceOrchestrator doesn't impact training performance
6. **Cancellation Validation**: Instant cancellation like DummyService

**Testing Strategy**:
```python
# Validate DummyService pattern compliance
def test_training_manager_follows_dummy_service_pattern():
    # 1. TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter]
    assert issubclass(TrainingManager, ServiceOrchestrator)

    # 2. Training methods are simple start_managed_operation() calls
    # (check method structure, not implementation details)

    # 3. Domain logic in clean _run_*_async() methods
    assert hasattr(TrainingManager, '_run_training_async')

    # 4. ServiceOrchestrator provides automatic capabilities
    training_manager = TrainingManager()
    assert hasattr(training_manager, 'start_managed_operation')
    assert hasattr(training_manager, 'get_current_cancellation_token')
    assert hasattr(training_manager, 'update_operation_progress')

def test_training_ux_matches_dummy_service():
    # Perfect UX: smooth progress and instant cancellation
    # (Integration test with operations API)
    pass

def test_cli_gets_structured_progress_automatically():
    # CLI gets structured data from operations API
    # No string parsing needed (like data loading CLI)
    pass
```

**Success Criteria (DummyService Pattern Compliance)**:
- [ ] TrainingManager inherits ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter] like DummyService pattern
- [ ] Training methods are single `start_managed_operation()` calls (zero boilerplate)
- [ ] Domain logic in clean `_run_*_async()` methods like DummyService
- [ ] ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL async complexity automatically
- [ ] Perfect UX achieved - smooth progress and instant cancellation
- [ ] CLI gets structured progress automatically (no manual integration)
- [ ] ALL existing training functionality preserved with ServiceOrchestrator benefits
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Training operations as simple as DummyService operations
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Same perfect UX quality as DummyService demonstrates
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Pattern consistency across DummyService, DataManager, and TrainingManager

## Architecture Consistency Analysis

**Perfect Pattern Reference - DummyService:**
```
DummyService (ServiceOrchestrator[None])
    â†“ (start_dummy_task() -> start_managed_operation())
    â†“ (_run_dummy_task_async() -> clean domain logic)
ServiceOrchestrator (handles ALL complexity automatically)
    â†“ (operations, progress, cancellation, API formatting)
[Perfect UX: smooth progress, instant cancellation, zero boilerplate]
```

**Successfully Applied - DataManager:**
```
DataManager (ServiceOrchestrator[IbDataAdapter])
    â†“ (load_data_async() -> start_managed_operation() like DummyService)
    â†“ (_run_data_load_async() -> clean domain logic like DummyService)
IbDataAdapter (routes: local IB vs host service)
    â†“ (complex data operations with ServiceOrchestrator benefits)
ServiceOrchestrator (handles ALL async complexity automatically)
```

**Target for Slice 3 - TrainingManager:**
```
TrainingManager (ServiceOrchestrator[TrainingAdapter]) <- ADD THIS
    â†“ (train_multi_symbol_strategy_async() -> start_managed_operation() like DummyService)
    â†“ (_run_training_async() -> clean domain logic like DummyService)
TrainingAdapter (routes: local training vs host service)
    â†“ (training operations with ServiceOrchestrator benefits)
ServiceOrchestrator (handles ALL async complexity automatically)
```

**Key Insight**: DummyService proves ServiceOrchestrator can make ANY service perfect with zero boilerplate:
- **DummyService**: 200-second dummy operation â†’ perfect UX with 50 lines of code
- **DataManager**: Complex data loading â†’ perfect UX following DummyService pattern
- **TrainingManager**: Training operations â†’ should have perfect UX like DummyService

**Why DummyService Pattern Works for Training**:
- **Simple delegation**: TrainingManager methods become single `start_managed_operation()` calls
- **Clean domain logic**: Training logic in `_run_training_async()` like `_run_dummy_task_async()`
- **ServiceOrchestrator benefits**: Automatic operations, progress, cancellation, API formatting
- **Perfect UX**: Smooth progress and instant cancellation like DummyService demonstrates
- **Zero boilerplate**: ServiceOrchestrator handles ALL complexity automatically

**Slice 3 Transformation**: Make TrainingManager follow DummyService pattern exactly, achieving the same perfect UX with minimal code.

- **Automatic benefits**: Operations, progress, cancellation, API formatting
- **Easy maintenance**: Follow proven DummyService pattern for all future services

## Integration Points

**Slice 4 Integration Readiness**:

- TrainingManager follows exact DummyService pattern for AsyncServiceAdapter integration
- ServiceOrchestrator patterns proven across DummyService, DataManager, and TrainingManager
- Unified async infrastructure foundation complete with perfect UX demonstrated
