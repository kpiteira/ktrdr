# KTRDR Async Architecture Implementation Tasks

This directory contains detailed task breakdowns for implementing the generic async architecture through 5 vertical slices. Each slice builds incrementally while delivering immediate, testable value.

## Implementation Strategy

### Vertical Slice Approach
- **Build Small**: Each slice adds one piece of infrastructure
- **Test Immediately**: Every component integrated and tested as built
- **Integrate Continuously**: Always have working, improved system
- **Deliver Value**: Each slice provides immediate benefits

## Slice Overview

### [Slice 1: Generic Progress Foundation](./SLICE-1-GENERIC-PROGRESS-FOUNDATION.md)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Goal**: Create working generic progress system integrated with DataManager.load_data()

**Key Deliverables**:
- GenericProgressManager with domain-agnostic core
- DataProgressRenderer for enhanced data operation messages  
- DataManager.load_data() using new progress infrastructure
- Foundation for cancellation and orchestration integration

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced progress messages with symbol/timeframe/mode context
- Foundation established for future slices

---

### [Slice 2: Cancellation System Integration](./SLICE-2-CANCELLATION-SYSTEM-INTEGRATION.md)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Goal**: Add universal cancellation to DataManager operations with <1 second response time

**Key Deliverables**:
- CancellationSystem for universal operation cancellation
- Integration with GenericProgressManager from Slice 1
- DataManager.load_data() with responsive cancellation
- Clean resource cleanup and exception handling

**Success Metrics**:
- Cancellation response time <1 second
- All Slice 1 functionality preserved
- No resource leaks from cancellation tokens

---

### [Slice 3: Training System Integration](./SLICE-3-TRAINING-SYSTEM-INTEGRATION.md)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Goal**: Use same infrastructure for training operations, achieving system consistency

**Key Deliverables**:
- TrainingProgressRenderer for training-specific context
- TrainingManager using ServiceOrchestrator patterns like DataManager
- TrainingManager integrated with async infrastructure
- Cross-system consistency validation

**Success Metrics**:
- Training operations use identical infrastructure as data
- Training-specific progress with model/symbol context
- Consistent cancellation across both systems
- Zero duplicate async infrastructure

---

### [Slice 4: Host Service Integration](./SLICE-4-HOST-SERVICE-INTEGRATION.md)
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Goal**: Add generic host service support with connection pooling for both systems

**Key Deliverables**:
- Generic AsyncServiceAdapter without domain coupling
- IB and Training adapters using shared connection pooling
- Unified cancellation across all host service communication
- Complete generic async infrastructure

**Success Metrics**:
- 30%+ performance improvement from connection pooling
- Both systems benefit from shared infrastructure
- No domain knowledge in generic components
- Complete unified async architecture

## Implementation Guidelines

### Task Structure
Each slice contains:
- **Daily Tasks**: Specific 1-day deliverables with acceptance criteria
- **Implementation Details**: Code examples and architecture guidance
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive validation strategies
- **Integration Points**: Preparation for subsequent slices

### Success Criteria
- **Functional**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance**: Measurable improvements with minimal overhead
- **Quality**: Enhanced user experience and developer experience
- **Architecture**: Clean separation and future-proof design

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental**: Small changes with immediate validation
- **Testable**: Every component tested before integration
- **Reversible**: Each slice can be rolled back independently
- **Consistent**: Same patterns across all implementations

## Usage Instructions

### For Implementation Teams
1. **Start with Slice 1**: Build foundation before advanced features
2. **Complete Each Slice**: Don't move to next slice until current one is validated
3. **Follow Task Order**: Daily tasks build on each other within slices
4. **Run All Tests**: Existing functionality must be preserved
5. **Measure Performance**: Track improvements at each slice

### For Project Management
- Each slice is independently valuable
- Progress can be paused after any slice
- Clear checkpoints for stakeholder review
- Risk distributed across 5 manageable chunks
- Continuous delivery of user value

### For Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive test requirements defined for each task
- Backward compatibility validation at every step  
- Performance benchmarking requirements specified
- Integration testing strategies provided
- Success metrics clearly defined

## Expected Outcomes

### After Slice 3 (Minimum Viable Infrastructure)
- Complete async orchestration for data operations
- Enhanced progress reporting and cancellation
- Measurable performance improvements
- One subsystem fully modernized

### After Slice 5 (Complete Infrastructure)
- Both data and training systems using shared infrastructure
- 30%+ performance improvements from connection pooling
- Consistent user experience across all operations
- Future-proof foundation for additional systems

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- No new external libraries required
- Builds on existing httpx, asyncio, threading
- Compatible with current FastAPI and CLI patterns

### Internal Dependencies
- Each slice depends on completion of previous slices
- Some tasks within slices have internal dependencies
- Clear dependency mapping provided in each slice

This task-driven approach ensures systematic progress toward unified async architecture while maintaining system stability and delivering continuous value.
