## ✅ Completed Slices

### Slice 1: Generic Progress Foundation (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested
**Completed**: September 2025

**Key Components**:
- ✅ GenericProgressManager - Thread-safe progress tracking
- ✅ ProgressRenderer abstract base - Domain-agnostic rendering interface
- ✅ DataProgressRenderer - Data-specific progress formatting
- ✅ DataManager integration - Rich progress messages with symbol/timeframe/mode context

**Evidence**:
- Code: [ktrdr/async_infrastructure/progress.py](/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/ktrdr/async_infrastructure/progress.py)
- Tests: All progress tests passing

- Rich training progress (epochs, batches, metrics)
- Consistent cancellation behavior across all systems

---

### Slice 5: Training Service Orchestrator Migration (COMPLETE)

**Status**: Fully implemented, end-to-end working
**Completed**: October 2025

**Key Components**:
- ✅ TrainingService inherits ServiceOrchestrator - Full orchestrator integration
- ✅ TrainingOperationContext - Immutable context with strategy validation
- ✅ TrainingProgressBridge - Translates training events to generic progress
- ✅ LocalTrainingRunner - Local execution wrapper with cancellation
- ✅ HostSessionManager - Remote training polling with backoff and cancellation
- ✅ Result aggregation - Unified schema for local and host results
- ✅ Progress + cancellation to host service - End-to-end flow working

**Evidence**:
- Code: [ktrdr/api/services/training_service.py](/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/ktrdr/api/services/training_service.py)
- Code: [ktrdr/api/services/training/](/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/ktrdr/api/services/training/) (context, bridge, runners, aggregation)
- Tests: Integration tests passing
- E2E: Progress and cancellation verified working to training-host-service

**Benefits Delivered**:
- Training is first-class ServiceOrchestrator client
- Smooth high-resolution progress (epochs, batches, ETA)
- Cancellation propagates cleanly to PyTorch loops and host service
- Reduced coupling between API and OperationsService
- Unified result schema across local and host execution

**Cleanup Status**:
- ✅ Legacy code removed: `_run_training_via_manager_async()` method deleted (99 lines)
- ⚠️ TrainingManager redundancy: Minor - TrainingManager used only for adapter initialization (acceptable delegation pattern)

## 🚧 Pending Work

### Slice 4: Host Service Integration (NOT STARTED) 🔴 **CRITICAL GAP**

**Status**: Specified but not implemented
**Priority**: Medium (system works, but missing performance optimization)

**The Problem**:
AsyncServiceAdapter infrastructure doesn't exist. Both `TrainingAdapter` and `IbDataAdapter` create ad-hoc HTTP clients without connection pooling, missing significant performance benefits.

**What's Missing**:

#### Infrastructure Layer
- ❌ `ktrdr/async_infrastructure/service_adapter.py` - Does not exist
- ❌ AsyncServiceAdapter base class with connection pooling
- ❌ Unified cancellation integration at adapter level
- ❌ Consistent error handling patterns

#### Adapter Implementations
- ❌ TrainingAdapter inherits AsyncServiceAdapter (currently creates new `httpx.AsyncClient` per request)
- ❌ IbDataAdapter inherits AsyncServiceAdapter (currently has separate HTTP management)
- ❌ Connection pooling (10 connections for IB, 5 for Training)
- ❌ Shared infrastructure between both adapters

#### Host Service Enhancements
- ❌ IB host service using unified async patterns
- ❌ Training host service using unified async patterns
- ❌ Structured progress reporting from host services
- ❌ Consistent cancellation handling

**Current State**:
```python
# TrainingAdapter (current implementation - no pooling!)
async def _call_host_service_post(self, endpoint: str, data: dict):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0) as client:  # New client each time!
        response = await client.post(url, json=data)
        return response.json()
```

**Target State** (per Slice 4 spec):
```python
# AsyncServiceAdapter base class
class AsyncServiceAdapter(ABC):
    async def _get_http_client(self):
        # Connection pooling with configurable limits
        if self._http_client is None:
            self._http_client = httpx.AsyncClient(
                base_url=self.config.base_url,
                timeout=httpx.Timeout(self.config.timeout),
                limits=httpx.Limits(max_connections=10, keepalive_expiry=30)
            )
        return self._http_client

# TrainingAdapter inherits pooled infrastructure
class TrainingAdapter(AsyncServiceAdapter):
    # Automatically gets connection pooling!
```

**Impact of Missing Slice 4**:
- ❌ 30%+ performance improvement **NOT** achieved
- ❌ Inconsistent patterns between IB and Training adapters
- ❌ Duplicate HTTP management code
- ✅ System **DOES** work correctly (just sub-optimal performance)

**Acceptance Criteria** (from [SLICE-4 spec](slices/pending/SLICE-4-HOST-SERVICE-INTEGRATION.md)):
- [ ] AsyncServiceAdapter base class created in `ktrdr/async_infrastructure/service_adapter.py`
- [ ] TrainingAdapter refactored to inherit AsyncServiceAdapter
- [ ] IbDataAdapter refactored to inherit AsyncServiceAdapter
- [ ] Connection pooling implemented and configured
- [ ] Unified cancellation integration at adapter level
- [ ] 30%+ performance improvement measured and documented
- [ ] Both IB and Training host services enhanced with structured progress
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all adapters

**Estimated Effort**: 1 week (per original slice plan)

## 🧹 Technical Debt

### Code Cleanup (COMPLETE)

**TrainingService Legacy Code**:
- Location: [ktrdr/api/services/training_service.py](/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/ktrdr/api/services/training_service.py)
- Issue: `_run_training_via_manager_async()` method (99 lines) was unused
- Impact: Confusing code paths resolved
- Action: Method deleted, unused imports cleaned up
- Status: ✅ **COMPLETE**

**TrainingManager Redundancy**:
- Location: [ktrdr/training/training_manager.py](/Users/karl/Documents/dev/ktrdr2/ktrdr/training/training_manager.py)
- Issue: TrainingManager exists as thin wrapper when TrainingService already inherits ServiceOrchestrator
- Impact: Unnecessary layer (TrainingService → TrainingManager → TrainingAdapter)
- Action: Consider consolidating TrainingManager functionality into TrainingService
- Status: ℹ️ Architectural consideration for future refactor

### Documentation Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- [ ] Verify all code examples in ARCHITECTURE.md match current implementation
- [ ] Update any outdated diagrams
- [ ] Ensure internal documentation links are correct
- [ ] Document Slice 4 gap prominently for new developers
