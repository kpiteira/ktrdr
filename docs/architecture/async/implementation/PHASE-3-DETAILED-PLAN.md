# Phase 3: Complete Async Integration - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Phase Overview

Phase 3 completes the async architecture transformation by optimizing the CLI layer, implementing connection pooling, establishing consistent async patterns across all services, and ensuring the entire system operates efficiently in the unified async architecture.

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 requires completion of Phase 2 (DataManager decomposition and all components operational).

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks of focused development

**Branch Strategy**: `feature/complete-async-integration` (main development branch for Phase 3)

## Core Architecture Goals

Phase 3 establishes the final unified async architecture:

```

├── Connection pooling & session management
├── Async command processing
└── Progress reporting & cancellation

Backend Services (fully async)
├── Consistent async patterns across all services
├── Shared progress/cancellation infrastructure
└── Connection pool management

Host Services (optimized)
├── Connection reuse and pooling
├── Performance monitoring
└── Resource optimization
```

## Task List
