# KTRDR Unified Async Architecture Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive analysis of both your IB and Training service paths, I recommend a **unified async service architecture** that takes the best patterns from your Training Host Service and applies them across your entire system. Your Training Host Service already demonstrates the right architectural approach - the solution is to extend this proven pattern to all operations while fixing the CLI layer inefficiencies that affect both paths.

## The Core Problem: Architectural Inconsistency

You currently have **two parallel architectures** that handle similar problems with different approaches:

**IB Path:** Great host service pattern, but broken by DataManager sync bottleneck
**Training Path:** Superior backend async flow, but same CLI inefficiencies

The solution is **architectural unification** around your proven microservice pattern.

## Recommended Unified Architecture

### 1. Standardize on the Host Service Pattern

Your Training Host Service proves that the **HTTP microservice pattern works excellently**. Extend this pattern to all external operations:

**Current State:**
- IB Host Service (good, but underutilized)
- Training Host Service (excellent pattern)
- Direct IB connections (problematic)

**Target State:**
- **Unified Host Services** for all external operations
- **Standard HTTP-based communication** for all services
- **Consistent session management** for long-running operations
- **Proper resource isolation** for all external dependencies

### 2. Fix the CLI Foundation Layer

Both IB and Training commands suffer from the **same CLI inefficiencies**. Create a unified CLI foundation that eliminates these problems:

**Current Problem Pattern (Both Paths):**
```python
@command()
def some_command(...):
    asyncio.run(_some_command_async(...))  # Creates new event loop every time
    
async def _some_command_async(...):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:  # Creates new HTTP client every time
        response = await client.request(...)
```

**Recommended Solution Pattern:**
```python
# New unified CLI foundation
class UnifiedAsyncCLI:
    def __init__(self):
        self._loop = None
        self._http_client = None
        self._api_client = None
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        # Reusable event loop and HTTP client
        self._http_client = httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0)
        self._api_client = KtrdrApiClient(self._http_client)
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if self._http_client:
            await self._http_client.aclose()

# Commands use the unified foundation
@command()
def train_model(...):
    async def _train_async():
        async with UnifiedAsyncCLI() as cli:
            return await cli.api_client.start_training(...)
    
    return asyncio.run(_train_async())

@command() 
def show_data(...):
    async def _show_async():
        async with UnifiedAsyncCLI() as cli:
            return await cli.api_client.get_data(...)
    
    return asyncio.run(_show_async())
```

### 3. Unify the Backend Service Layer

Create a standard async service foundation that both data and training operations can use:

**Standard Async Service Base:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
import httpx

class AsyncHostService(ABC):
    """Base class for all host service integrations."""
    
    def __init__(
        self, 
        service_name: str,
        use_host_service: bool = False,
        host_service_url: Optional[str] = None,
        timeout: float = 30.0
    ):
        self.service_name = service_name
        self.use_host_service = use_host_service
        self.host_service_url = host_service_url
        self.timeout = timeout
        self._client: Optional[httpx.AsyncClient] = None
    
    async def _get_client(self) -> httpx.AsyncClient:
        """Get or create HTTP client for host service communication."""
        if self._client is None:
            self._client = httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=self.timeout)
        return self._client
    
    async def _call_host_service_post(self, endpoint: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Standard POST call to host service."""
        if not self.use_host_service:
            raise RuntimeError(f"{self.service_name} host service not enabled")
        
        client = await self._get_client()
        url = f"{self.host_service_url}{endpoint}"
        
        try:
            response = await client.post(url, json=data)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except httpx.HTTPError as e:
            raise ServiceConnectionError(f"{self.service_name} host service request failed: {str(e)}")
    
    async def _call_host_service_get(self, endpoint: str, params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Standard GET call to host service."""
        if not self.use_host_service:
            raise RuntimeError(f"{self.service_name} host service not enabled")
        
        client = await self._get_client()
        url = f"{self.host_service_url}{endpoint}"
        
        try:
            response = await client.get(url, params=params or {})
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except httpx.HTTPError as e:
            raise ServiceConnectionError(f"{self.service_name} host service request failed: {str(e)}")
    
    async def close(self):
        """Clean up HTTP client resources."""
        if self._client:
            await self._client.aclose()
            self._client = None
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check if the service is healthy and available."""
        pass
```

### 4. Standardize Service Adapters

Both data and training adapters should follow the same pattern:

**Unified Data Adapter (Async):**
```python
class AsyncDataAdapter(AsyncHostService):
    """Unified async data adapter for IB operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, use_host_service: bool = False, host_service_url: str = None):
        super().__init__(
            service_name="IB",
            use_host_service=use_host_service,
            host_service_url=host_service_url or "http://localhost:5001"
        )
        
        # Initialize local components only if not using host service
        if not use_host_service:
            self.symbol_validator = IbSymbolValidator()
            self.data_fetcher = IbDataFetcher()
        else:
            self.symbol_validator = None
            self.data_fetcher = None
    
    async def fetch_historical_data(self, symbol: str, timeframe: str, **kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Fetch historical data using host service or local connection."""
        if self.use_host_service:
            # Use host service (recommended)
            response = await self._call_host_service_post("/data/historical", {
                "symbol": symbol,
                "timeframe": timeframe,
                **kwargs
            })
            # Convert response to DataFrame
            return pd.DataFrame(response["data"])
        else:
            # Local connection (fallback)
            return await self.data_fetcher.fetch_data_async(symbol, timeframe, **kwargs)
    
    async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check IB service health."""
        if self.use_host_service:
            return await self._call_host_service_get("/health")
        else:
            # Local health check
            return {"status": "healthy", "mode": "local"}

class AsyncTrainingAdapter(AsyncHostService):
    """Unified async training adapter."""
    
    def __init__(self, use_host_service: bool = False, host_service_url: str = None):
        super().__init__(
            service_name="Training",
            use_host_service=use_host_service,
            host_service_url=host_service_url or "http://localhost:5002"
        )
        
        # Initialize local trainer only if not using host service
        if not use_host_service:
            from .train_strategy import StrategyTrainer
            self.local_trainer = StrategyTrainer()
        else:
            self.local_trainer = None
    
    async def start_training_session(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Start training using host service or local trainer."""
        if self.use_host_service:
            # Use host service (recommended)
            return await self._call_host_service_post("/training/start", config)
        else:
            # Local training (fallback)
            return await self.local_trainer.train_async(config)
    
    async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Check training service health."""
        if self.use_host_service:
            return await self._call_host_service_get("/health")
        else:
            return {"status": "healthy", "mode": "local"}
```

### 5. Make All Managers Consistently Async

The DataManager should follow the same async pattern as TrainingManager:

**Async Data Manager:**
```python
class AsyncDataManager:
    """Async data manager following the same pattern as TrainingManager."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_adapter = self._initialize_data_adapter()
    
    def _initialize_data_adapter(self) -> AsyncDataAdapter:
        """Initialize data adapter based on environment variables."""
        env_enabled = os.getenv("USE_IB_HOST_SERVICE", "").lower()
        use_host_service = env_enabled in ("true", "1", "yes")
        host_service_url = os.getenv("IB_HOST_SERVICE_URL", "http://localhost:5001")
        
        return AsyncDataAdapter(
            use_host_service=use_host_service,
            host_service_url=host_service_url
        )
    
    async def load_data(
        self, 
        symbol: str, 
        timeframe: str, 
        start_date: str, 
        end_date: str,
        source: str = "ib"
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Load data asynchronously."""
        if source == "ib":
            return await self.data_adapter.fetch_historical_data(
                symbol=symbol,
                timeframe=timeframe,
                start_date=start_date,
                end_date=end_date
            )
        elif source == "local":
            # Local file loading (already async-safe)
            return await self._load_local_data_async(symbol, timeframe, start_date, end_date)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown data source: {source}")
    
    async def get_health_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get health status of data services."""
        return await self.data_adapter.health_check()
```

## Implementation Strategy

## Conclusion

Your Training Host Service already proves that the microservice async pattern works excellently. The recommended approach takes this proven success and extends it across your entire architecture, while fixing the CLI inefficiencies that affect both paths.

This isn't about rewriting everything - it's about **standardizing on your successful patterns** and **eliminating the architectural inconsistencies** that create maintenance burden and performance problems.

The result will be a **unified, maintainable, and high-performance** async architecture that leverages the best of both your current implementations while eliminating their individual weaknesses.
