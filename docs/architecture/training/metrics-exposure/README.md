# Training Metrics Exposure for Agent Decision Making

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Branch**: `feature/training-metrics-exposure`
**Date**: 2025-01-17

---

## Overview

This feature enables AI agents to query and analyze training metrics in real-time, allowing them to make intelligent decisions about early stopping, overfitting detection, and training health assessment.

**Key Innovation**: API-first approach - build complete interface first, then "light up" functionality incrementally.

## Quick Start

### Read in Order

1. **Start here**: [Problem Statement](./01-problem-statement.md) - Understand what we're solving and why
2. [Design](./02-design.md) - See the solution approach and API structure
3. [Architecture](./03-architecture.md) - Understand how it works (local + host service)
4. [Implementation Plan](./04-implementation-plan.md) - Step-by-step development roadmap

### Implementation Approach

**API-First**: Build the complete interface (API + MCP client + agent scripts) BEFORE implementing functionality.

**Benefit**: Run agent scripts from day 1. Each milestone makes them return more data without changing the interface.

---

## Implementation Milestones

### M1: API Contract (Interface First)

Build complete vertical slice - API endpoints, MCP client, agent examples. Everything runs, returns empty data.

**Validation**: Run agent scripts, see "No metrics yet" (but valid structure)

### M2: Light Up Local Training

Implement metrics collection for local training. Same agent scripts now show real data!

**Validation**: Run same agent scripts, see actual epoch data

### M3: Light Up Host Service

Extend to GPU training via host service. Same agent scripts work remotely.

**Validation**: Run same agent scripts with GPU training

### M4: Polish

Documentation, performance validation, production-ready.

## Agent Script Example

**This same command works in every milestone** (with progressively more data):

```bash
python examples/agents/training_monitor.py {operation_id}
```

**Output Evolution**:

- **M1**: ⏳ No metrics yet (API returns empty)
- **M2**: ✅ Epoch 0: train_loss=0.8234, val_loss=0.8912 (local training)
- **M3**: ✅ Epoch 0: train_loss=0.8234, val_loss=0.8912 (GPU training)
- **M4**: Same + polished documentation

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Generic `metrics` field** - Not training-specific, supports all operation types
2. **Works for both modes** - Local training and host service (GPU)
3. **API-first approach** - Interface before implementation
4. **Incremental validation** - Test at every milestone
5. **Agent-friendly** - Simple MCP interface for decision making

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Estimated**: 2-3 days of focused development

**Per Milestone**:

- M1: 6-8 hours (complete interface stack)
- M2: 8-10 hours (metrics collection implementation)
- M3: 4-6 hours (HTTP forwarding layer)
- M4: 2-4 hours (documentation + polish)

---

## Success Criteria

At the end of M4, agents can:

- ✅ Monitor training in real-time
- ✅ Detect overfitting (train_loss ↓ while val_loss ↑)
- ✅ Detect plateaus (no improvement in N epochs)
- ✅ Identify best epoch (lowest validation loss)
- ✅ Recommend early stopping or continuation
- ✅ Provide intelligent analysis of training health

---

## Next Steps

1. Review all documentation
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/training-metrics-exposure`
3. Commit documentation
4. Start M1 implementation
